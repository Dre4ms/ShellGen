## ShellGen<br>

**NOTE:** This only works for *tun0* IP.

* I made this script as it saves time copying reverse shell from the internet and changing IP and port everytime while doing pentest on a box.<br>

* Reverse shell generator which takes a port number to genertae a reverse shell on your tun0 IP<br>

* Python/Python3 pty generator <br>
